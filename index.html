					<h3>About Me Page</h3>
					<p>This was my first attempt at coding. I used Code Pen to try my hand at html and CSS</p>

					<p>The Karma landing page clone project was by far the most challenging, but the most fun. This is where I spent time understanding the concepts and exploring the functionality of html and CSS.</p>

					<h3>New York Times Hack</h3>
					<p>"Hacking" the New York Times homepage has become my favorite party trick.  It's pretty fun to surprise people with outrageous headlines that include their names and pictures.</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="info">
					<p>I reluctantly want to describe myself as just a mom and a wife, but in reality, that's who I am now. Although I work full time in the social services field, you can most often find me surfing the web for ways to make my family's life enjoyable. From "get your toddler to eat more veggies" to "how to get rid of 'desk butt'," I like to read and learn about it all.</p>
  					<p>What is important to me is that I feel challenged at whatever task I am undertaking. It's important to me to set a good example of hard work and dedication for my family. And to accomplish a goal I have set for myself.</p>
